=============================================

## Install
```
npm install [--save] overpass-extractor
```

## Usage
```
npm test.js route=road
```

## Constant & Variables
```js
const overpassQuery = require('./overpassQuery');
const Point = require('./Point');
const overpassExtractor = require('./overpassExtractor');

var Relation = require('./Relation');
var fs = require("fs");
var Way = require('./Way');
```

#### Overpass Query
```js
overpassQuery.generalQuery(process.argv[2])
              .then((overpassTurbo) => {

                 /// Do something with overpassTurbo (Overpass is a GeoJson)

              })
              .catch((err) => {

                    console.log("Errore");
                    console.log(err);
              });
```

#### Overpass Extractor
```js
overpassExtractor.relationFeatureExtractor(overpassTurbo);
overpassExtractor.wayFeatureExtractor(overpassTurbo);
overpassExtractor.pointFeatureExtractor(overpassTurbo);
overpassExtractor.setRelated(results[0],results[1]);
```

## Query Methods

#### `overpassQuery.generalQuery(mapFeatureString)`
Executes the query, returns a Promise that, when resolved, gives the GeoJson.
 - `mapFeatureString` defines a pair key=value, like route=road, (you can find [OSM:MapFeatures](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features)) .

#### `overpassExtractor.relationFeatureExtractor(overpassTurbo);`
 Manage the GeoJson. Instantiate a new Relation feature that you can manage with its own methods. Return a promise with a Json of Javascript Class.
 - `overpassTurbo` is a GeoJson get by query overpass service.

#### `overpassExtractor.wayFeatureExtractor(overpassTurbo);`
Manage the GeoJson. Instantiate a new Way feature that you can manage with its own methods. Return a promise with a Json of Javascript Class. 
 - `overpassTurbo` is a GeoJson get by query overpass service.


#### `overpassExtractor.pointFeatureExtractor(overpassTurbo);`
Manage the GeoJson. Instantiate a new Point feature that you can manage with its own methods. Return a promise with a Json of Javascript Class.
 - `overpassTurbo` is a GeoJson get by query overpass service.


#### `overpassExtractor.setRelated(results[0],results[1]);`
Manage two GeoJsons. Relate a OSM relation with a OSM way. Return a Json of Javascript Class.
 - `results[0]` is a Json managed by a feature extractor.
 - `results[1]` is a Json managed by a feature extractor.
